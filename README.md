# #StayTheFuckHome - WoltLab Suite Extension
A Movement to Stop the COVID-19 Pandemic

Our governments are only slowly implementing measures to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and containing the COVID-19 pandemic. Slow reactions, public appeasement policies, and their urge to stabilize the economy have kept them from taking the measures needed to protect millions from this disease. However, it is not only the government's burden to bear.



It is time for us, as citizens of this earth, to take action now and do our part in fighting COVID-19.



This extension for WoltLab Suite 3+ has been created to remind you and your visitors, why it's important to stay home and avoid contact to other people as much as possible, during the current situation.



When visiting your website, the user will be greeted with an information popup. The visitor is free to close it or click the link within this popup that leads to an information page regarding the Corona Virus (COVID-19).



This extension is a community project by [Staythefuckhome.com](https://staythefuckhome.com) & [SoftCreatR Media](https://www.softcreatr.com).
